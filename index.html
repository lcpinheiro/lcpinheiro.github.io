### Moving beyond buzzwords

Rapidly **evolving technology** and **abundant collectable data** have allowed multiple developments which present **disruptive innovation potential**.

Healthcare sector has lagged behind but is starting to harvest the benefits underlying the buzzwords:

.pull-left[
- Big data
- Artificial intelligence
- ML or predictive analytics&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;
- Deep learning and Neural networkds
]

.pull-right[
- Natural language processing/generation
- Image pattern recognition 
- Robotics
- Blockchain
]

.footnote[
&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; *I will refer to ML and Predictive analytics as synonyms. They are not the same but go hand-in-hand* 
]

### The good old p&lt;0.05 days

- Inferential analytics
  - Aim to identify and quantify causality 
  - Statistical significance underpins inferential analytics&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; and anchors many (most) regulatory actions
  - Established methods, e.g. post-hoc analyses discouraged as possibly fraudulant 
  
- Machine learning (Predictive analytics)
  - Finds patterns,i.e. correlations in the data
  - Decision making relies on performance not significance levels
  - Choosing the best performing model is "best" practice

.footnote[
&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; *Abuse of p-value statistics is a contentious issue*
]

### Human-Technology interface 

Besides analytics, technological developments in the AI spectrum can bring efficiency and capacity gains:

- NLP to extract data from unstrucured text (and possibly fit in an analytic pipeline)

- Better visualisation of big data (standard reporting and interactivity)

- Robotics to perform repeat and simple rule-based activities

---

### AI transformation - Leveraging ML in drug regulation  

Hundreds of sucessful companies prove there is a space for these technologies. **This space is not in replacing traditional technologies**.

Things we need to understand:
- Where the value of predictive analytics in regulatory science is,

- How to define and assess the acceptibility of individual models,

- How to regulate models that will come from third parties,

- How to cooperate with academia and other skilled research groups,

- Ethical implementation of predictive analytics

---
### Big data taskforce

Big data taskforce is scoping and planning how to address the issues mentioned. The Research Subgroup, in particular is looking at where to invest on much needed research. 

In the next few years research will be commissioned, done in partnerships and internally.

Building up internal knowledge and partnerships is fundamental: 
- **to ensure role as independent regulators including of novel analytical technologies applied to medicine development and monitoring** 
- **to adequately harvest these technologies in our internal procedures**.  

---
### PhD proposal

My doctoral plan proposal **addresses research opportunities that the Big Data taksforce will invest in**. The doctoral plan aims to fill a gap in knowledge.

It will be performed in a **leading University on health data analytics - Erasmus MC - with extensive experience in Predictive analytics and RWE**.

**Prof. Peter Rijnbeek (Erasmus MC, OHDSI, EDHEN)** has kindly accepted to be the PhD coordinator. 

In addition, Erasmus MC is a Dutch University, which allows me to work **in-loco** with other PhD students, researchers and Professors.

### Topics to brainstorm

Machine Learning applications on drug safety
- **Aim** - **1)** understand usefulness of models and **2)** develop a framework to implement in decision making.  
  - Research comparing traditional methods to predictive analytics to understand the added benefit. Particularly interesting to model safety concerns that were discussed multiple times. 
  - Research to model risk minimisation measures. Understand which are in line with predictive model insights and those that are not and compare results.
 
Validation of third-party models
- **Aim** - **3)** understand how to perform an adequate oversight of models developed by MAHs that affect health outcomes. 
- Reseach in acceptability of models, such as transportability of model, transparency, etc.
 
Use of unstructured information
- **Aim** - **4)** to develop the skillset to extract information from unstructured text and use it in an analytical pipeline
Research of semi-automated extraction of data in medicines regulation documents and use it in an analytical pipeline .

### Personal motivation

- I am an **early adopter**
  - Done pilot studies and research in ML and NLP at Department level
  - Am research oriented and innovation focused

- I am a **coder**
  - Throughout my career I've used: VB, Html, CSS, R, SAS, Python 
  
- I enjoy **academic environment**
  - Worked six years in academia and enjoy 
  
- Learning is one of my **hobbies**
  - Stanford Uni course on Data Science and ML
  - deeplearning.ai course
  - Datacamp coding courses
  - Lead the code club at ema
