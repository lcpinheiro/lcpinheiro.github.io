### Moving beyond buzzwords

Rapidly **evolving technology** and **abundant collectable data** have allowed multiple developments which present **disruptive innovation potential**.

![Buzzword images](http://www.aexonic.com/peak-into-our-mind/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/1saR9hqUf-d_qBVsbIGXing-1.png)

Buzzwords are becoming jargons used routinely, often before they are trully defined or understood.

### Digital and AI transformation

**Digital and AI transformation** is a simple, all-emcompassing, albeit imperfect, way of defining the the process of levereging new technologies and analytics in a company. 
Digital and AI transformation is a significant challenge for regulatory authorities (RA).

.pull-left[
**Address their transformation**

- Predictive health intelligence 
- Automated administrative workflow assistance 
- Advanced data exploration and categorisation  
- Increased cybersecurity
- Personalised stakeholder experience
- Etc.
]

.pull-right[
**Be able to regulate others**

- Automated patient monitoring with wearables
- Dose error reduction
- Clinical-trial participant identifier
- Automated image diagnostics
- Risk strafitication of patients  
- ?

]

**Will take years to get the full promise. Equally, it will take years to build required skillsets.** 

---
### The good old p&lt;0.05 days

AI &amp; Digital transformation is a spectrum: from **big data analytics** (i.e. machine learning) to explicitely coded **rule-based systems** (e.g. robotics).

In regulation, big data analytics traditionally involve two approaches: **descriptive and inferential**. 

Inferential analytics and statistical significance&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; underpins many (most) regulatory actions.
  
Predictive analytics is a big change: it aims to model correlations not causality, decision making relies on performance not significance levels. Post-hoc choosing of the best performing model is normal practice, not fraud. 

.footnote[
&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; *(Ab)Use of p-value statistics is a contentious issue*

### Implementation of predictive analytics

Key aspects we need to understand before/to perform implementation

.pull-left[
- **Value** in regulatory science
- **Place** in analytical pipeline
- **Validity** of models
]
.pull-right[
- **Acceptibility** of methods
- **Role** of Academia and research groups
- **Ethical** dimension
]

### Big data taskforce

Big data taskforce is scoping and planning how to address the issues mentioned. Highly likely that in the next few years research will be **commissioned and or done in partnerships**.

Bilding up **in-house competencies** is equally crucial: 

- to ensure our continued role as regulators in a digital world (not dependent on private consultancy),
- to leverange these technologies in our internal procedures: 
  - "An algorithm devoid of causal expert knowledge will rely exclusively on the associations found in the data and is therefore at risk of selecting features that increase bias".

---
### Research proposal

PhD proposal addresses **research that the Big Data taksforce aims to invest in**. It fills a gap in knowledge.

Performed in a **leading University on health data analytics - Erasmus MC -** with extensive experience in Predictive analytics and RWE.

**Prof. Peter Rijnbeek (Erasmus MC, OHDSI, EDHEN)** has kindly accepted to be the PhD coordinator. 

Erasmus MC is a Dutch University - possibility to work **in-house** with other PhD students, researchers and Professors.

### PhD topics to refine - ML on drug safety 

Machine Learning applications on drug safety

**Aims** 
- **1)** understand usefulness of models and; 
- **2)** develop a framework to implement in decision-making.
  
  - Comparing traditional inferential analytics to predictive analytics to understand the added benefit, i.e. different results, stratification of risk, etc. E.g. a statin has a risk of rhabdomyolysis, can we predict the likelihood of a patient with certain risk factors developing rhabdomyolysis?
  
  - Assess impact of risk minimisation measures (RMM) based on their match to predictive models. E.g. identify important features in the prediction of an adverse reaction and check if they are considered in RMM.
  
  - Apply ML to in-house Observational data, on specific ADRs to see if we can predict the ocurrence of these ADRs based on a pattern of reporting terms. E.g. can we predict anaphylaxis on a new medicinal product based on reports of other immune related reactions?
  
  - Research on model intepretability. Compare black-box models (less interpretable, more accurate) to CART models (less accurate, more interpretable). What is the performance loss for the prediction of adverse drug reactions.
  
---
### PhD topics to refine - Validating third-party models

Validation of third-party models

**Aim**
- **3)** understand how to perform an adequate oversight of models developed by MAHs that affect health outcomes. 

  - Consider acceptability of models by regulatory agencies. What are the elements required to assess and accept a third party model. E.g. can we ask proof of transportability of model (how models can be tested in different datasets), transparency, coding literacy, etc.

---
### PhD topics to refine - Harvesting unstructured information

Use of unstructured information

**Aim**
- **4)** to develop the skillset to extract information from unstructured text and use it in an analytical pipeline

  - Using semi-automated extraction of data in medicines regulation documents. Can we classify case reports better using NLP and regex? E.g. check whether narratives have information that matches a case definition, such as anaphylactic reaction. 


---
### Personal motivation

- I am an **early adopter** with positive results
  - Done pilot studies and research in ML and NLP at Department level

- I am a **coder**
  - Throughout my career I've used: VB, Html, CSS, **R, SAS, Python** 
  
- I enjoy **academic environment**
  - Worked six years in academia and enjoy 
  
- Learning is one of my **hobbies**
  - Stanford Uni course on Data Science and ML
  - deeplearning.ai course
  - Datacamp coding courses
  - Lead the code club at EMA
  
---
### Summary

- AI &amp; Digital transformation offer immense potential for improvement and innovation

- EMA should develop internal skillset (content knowledge is required for best use of tools) 

- Have been a coder for years, in the past three at EMA I have worked ever more frequently in Big Data and AI initiatives with good success

- PhD proposal offers mutual interest in terms of research and academic collaboration
